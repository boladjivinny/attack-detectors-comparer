# Botnet detectots comparer

This is an improved version of the [Botnet Detectors Comparer](http://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/botnetdetectorscomparer/BotnetDetectorsComparer-0.9.tgz)
software that is used to compare botnet detection techniques. This version 
uses Python3 and intends to be less rigid than the previous version which 
makes assumptions on the position of the fields.

By putting this version out, the expectation is to make it easier to test the
techniques and also provide a repository for implementation results so that
predictions are clearly shared.
